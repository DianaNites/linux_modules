nms-remove 
Remove/unload a kernel module

USAGE:
    nms remove [OPTIONS] <NAME>

ARGS:
    <NAME>
            Name of the module to unload

OPTIONS:
    -f, --force
            Force unload the module.
            
            This is extremely dangerous and can cause serious system instability. Not all modules
            are designed to be unloaded, and this can cause a module currently being used to be
            unloaded.
