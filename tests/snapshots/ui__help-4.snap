nms-remove 0.3.3-alpha.0
Remove/unload a kernel module

USAGE:
    nms remove [FLAGS] <name>

FLAGS:
    -f, --force    
            Force unload the module.
            
            This is extremely dangerous and can cause serious system instability. Not all modules are designed to be
            unloaded, and this can cause a module currently being used to be unloaded.
            
            USE AT YOUR OWN RISK
    -h, --help     
            Prints help information
